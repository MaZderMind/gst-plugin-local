gst-plugin-local
----------------

This Plugins aims to be a replacement for the inter* Elements that better handles
A/V Synchronisation and unreliable Sources.

It's made for [Voctomix](https://github.com/voc/voctomix/) but should be of use
for any Gstreamer-System that processes live Video with unreliable Sources.
